 Implementation Plan: Secure Client-Side Mail Credential Management

  Current State Assessment

  - PGP authentication is properly implemented for platform access
  - Mail passwords are currently stored server-side (encrypted in users table)
  - No client-side encryption for mail credentials exists
  - The codebase has solid PGP utilities that can be leveraged

  Work Packages

  Tasks:
  1. Create a mailCredentialManager.js utility in src/lib/mail/
    - Functions for encrypting/decrypting mail credentials using session key
    - Secure localStorage wrapper with encryption
    - Session key derivation from auth token
  2. Update authentication flow to establish secure session
    - Derive encryption key from successful PGP authentication
    - Manage session lifecycle securely
  3. Add credential validation functions
    - IMAP/SMTP credential validation
    - Password strength verification

  Time Estimate: 2-3 days

  Package 2: Mail Account Setup & Credential UI

    - Update credentials

  Time Estimate: 3-4 days

  Package 3: Mail API & Backend Updates

  Objective: Modify backend to stop storing mail passwords

  Tasks:
  1. Update virtual_users table schema and related code
    - Remove mail_password from users table
    - Ensure user_id foreign key in virtual_users

    - Modify API calls to include credentials when needed
    - Implement credential caching during session
    - Add credential prompt when accessing mail features
  2. Update email sending functionality
    - Use client-side credentials for SMTP
    - Implement PGP signing/encryption options
  3. Create persistent mail sessions
    - Allow "remember me" for mail credentials (encrypted)
    - Implement automatic credential retrieval from storage

  Time Estimate: 3-4 days

  Package 5: Testing & Security Audit

  Objective: Ensure security and functionality of the implementation

  Tasks:
  1. Unit testing for credential management
    - Test encryption/decryption functionality
    - Test storage mechanisms
    - Test password validation
  2. Integration testing
    - End-to-end mail flow testing
    - Authentication flow testing
    - Credential management UI testing
  3. Security audit
    - Review client-side encryption implementation
    - Check for any credential leakage
    - Verify proper cleanup of sensitive data

  Time Estimate: 2-3 days

  Implementation Details

  Client-Side Encryption Approach

  1. Session Key Derivation:
  // After successful PGP authentication
  const sessionKey = await deriveSessionKey(authToken, userFingerprint);
  sessionStorage.setItem('session_key', sessionKey);
  2. Credential Encryption:
  // Encrypt mail credentials before storage
  const encryptedCredentials = await encryptWithSessionKey(
    sessionKey,
    JSON.stringify({
      email: email,
      password: password,
      server: server,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    })
  );
  localStorage.setItem(`mail_cred_${accountId}`, encryptedCredentials);
  3. Credential Retrieval:
  // When accessing mail
  const sessionKey = sessionStorage.getItem('session_key');
  const encryptedCredentials = localStorage.getItem(`mail_cred_${accountId}`);
  const credentials = JSON.parse(await decryptWithSessionKey(sessionKey, encryptedCredentials));

  // Check if expired
  if (Date.now() - credentials.timestamp > CREDENTIAL_EXPIRY) {
    // Prompt for re-entry
  }

  Database Updates

  Remove the mail_password column from the users table while keeping the virtual_users table intact. Mail passwords will still be stored in hashed form in
   virtual_users for Dovecot, but we will not store the plaintext version anywhere.

  UI Flow for Mail Access

  1. User logs in with PGP authentication
  2. When accessing mail features for the first time in a session:
    - Prompt for mail password
    - Offer "Remember for this session" or "Remember on this device" options
  3. If remembered, encrypt and store credentials
  4. Use stored credentials for subsequent mail operations

  Timeline and Dependencies

  - Total Estimated Time: 2-3 weeks
  - Critical Path: Packages 1 → 2 → 4
  - Parallel Development: Package 3 can be developed alongside Package 2

  Security Considerations

  - Ensure proper encryption of all stored credentials
  - Implement proper session management and timeout
  - Never send plaintext credentials to server except for initial account setup
  - Clear credentials on logout
  - Implement rate limiting for credential validation attempts

## Future Feature Ideas

### Automatic PGP Key Discovery

**Concept:** Automatically discover and import PGP public keys from incoming emails by scanning for:
- Links to major keyservers (keys.openpgp.org, keyserver.ubuntu.com, etc.)
- Attached public key files (.asc)
- Key IDs or fingerprints in email signatures

**Implementation Details:**
1. Build a parser to scan incoming email content for:
   - Regex patterns to detect keyserver URLs
   - File attachments with proper PGP public key format
   - Standard key ID formats in email text/signatures

2. Create a secure address book system to:
   - Store discovered public keys mapped to email addresses
   - Validate keys before storage
   - Update keys when newer versions are detected
   - Allow manual approval option (configurable)

3. Enhance compose UI to:
   - Show encryption status for recipients based on available keys
   - Auto-enable encryption when keys are available
   - Provide visual indicators of encryption capability

**Benefits:**
- Frictionless encryption without requiring manual key exchange
- Network effect: as more people share their keys, encryption becomes ubiquitous
- Progressive enhancement of security with minimal user effort
- Differentiation from other secure email services

**Implementation Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium-High
**Impact:** High
**Dependencies:** 2.2 PGP Implementation, 1.3 User Dashboard

This development plan will be regularly updated as progress is made and requirements evolve.
