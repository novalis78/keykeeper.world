## Future Feature Ideas

### Automatic PGP Key Discovery

**Concept:** Automatically discover and import PGP public keys from incoming emails by scanning for:
- Links to major keyservers (keys.openpgp.org, keyserver.ubuntu.com, etc.)
- Attached public key files (.asc)
- Key IDs or fingerprints in email signatures

**Implementation Details:**
1. Build a parser to scan incoming email content for:
   - Regex patterns to detect keyserver URLs
   - File attachments with proper PGP public key format
   - Standard key ID formats in email text/signatures

2. Create a secure address book system to:
   - Store discovered public keys mapped to email addresses
   - Validate keys before storage
   - Update keys when newer versions are detected
   - Allow manual approval option (configurable)

3. Enhance compose UI to:
   - Show encryption status for recipients based on available keys
   - Auto-enable encryption when keys are available
   - Provide visual indicators of encryption capability

**Benefits:**
- Frictionless encryption without requiring manual key exchange
- Network effect: as more people share their keys, encryption becomes ubiquitous
- Progressive enhancement of security with minimal user effort
- Differentiation from other secure email services

**Implementation Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium-High
**Impact:** High
**Dependencies:** 2.2 PGP Implementation, 1.3 User Dashboard

### Automatic Public Key Attachment

**Concept:** Automatically attach the sender's public key to every outgoing email sent through KeyKeeper.

**Implementation Details:**
1. Build a system to:
   - Retrieve the user's public key during email composition
   - Attach it as a standard .asc file to every outgoing email
   - Optionally include it in OpenPGP header format for compatibility with various clients

2. Add configuration options to:
   - Enable/disable automatic key attachment (default: enabled)
   - Choose attachment method (file, header, or both)
   - Add a customizable email signature that explains the key attachment

3. Create visual indicators in the UI:
   - Show when a key will be attached to an outgoing email
   - Allow easy viewing of the attached public key
   - Provide education about the benefits of key sharing

**Benefits:**
- Creates a "virtuous cycle" of key exchange where each email enables secure return communication
- Promotes wider adoption of encryption by removing key distribution barriers
- Establishes KeyKeeper as a platform that prioritizes encryption by default
- Complements the automatic key discovery feature perfectly
- Creates a network effect that increases the value of the platform over time

**Implementation Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** High
**Dependencies:** 2.2 PGP Implementation

This development plan will be regularly updated as progress is made and requirements evolve.



Based on my assessment of the codebase, here's what we've implemented so far regarding automatic public key attachment in emails:

  1. Functionality Implementation Status:
    - ✅ Fetching user's public key is implemented via /api/user/public-key endpoint
    - ✅ ComposeEmail component fetches and attaches the user's public key (lines 63-108, 185-197)
    - ✅ The send/route.js has code in place to handle public key attachments (lines 49-56)
    - ✅ The public key is properly attached as public_key.asc with the correct MIME type
  2. What's Working:
    - The email composer retrieves the user's public key
    - The key is attached to outgoing emails as "public_key.asc"
    - The correct content type "application/pgp-keys" is set
  3. What's Missing:
    - ❌ There's no code to extract received public keys from incoming emails
    - ❌ No contact/address book implementation to store these keys
    - ❌ No UI indication of contacts with available public keys
    - ❌ No automatic handling to hide the PGP attachments from the UI display

  Let me add these items to our todo list with more detail:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Fix login page input width to match signup page
     ☐ Improve mobile responsiveness for login/signup flows
     ☐ Add email attachment handling for sending and receiving
     ☐ Add email search functionality
     ☐ Improve error handling and user feedback
     ☐ Extract public keys from received emails and store in contacts
     ☐ Build contact/address book functionality with PGP key support
     ☐ Implement disposable email address generation and management
     ☐ Add dark mode toggle in user settings
     ☐ Create onboarding tutorial for new users
     ☐ Implement email filtering and folder organization
     ☐ Add unit and integration tests for critical functionality
     ☐ Performance optimization for large mailboxes
     ☐ Create UI to indicate encrypted communication availability with contacts
     ☐ Hide PGP key attachments in email display UI
     ☐ Test automatic public key exchange with real mail clients

● I've analyzed the current implementation of the public key attachment feature. Here's where we stand:

  What's already implemented:
  - The user's public key is properly fetched from the database via the /api/user/public-key endpoint
  - The ComposeEmail component retrieves and attaches the key automatically to outgoing emails
  - The key is correctly attached as "public_key.asc" with the proper MIME type "application/pgp-keys"
  - The send/route.js API has handling for preserving these attachments during transmission

  What still needs to be implemented:
  1. Extract public keys from received emails - when a user receives an email with a PGP key attachment, we need to detect and process it
  2. Build a contacts database to store these keys
  3. Create UI indicators to show which contacts have PGP keys available for encryption
  4. Hide the PGP key attachments in the email display UI (they're technical files that shouldn't clutter the interface)

  The foundation for automatic key exchange is there, but the receiving side of the workflow needs to be completed for the feature to be fully functional.
