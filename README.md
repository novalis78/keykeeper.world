# KeyKeeper.world

*Secure email services powered by OpenPGP*

## Overview

KeyKeeper.world is a privacy-focused mail service designed as a companion to the SecureMailClient desktop application. It combines PGP encryption with disposable email addresses to provide a comprehensive security solution for privacy-conscious users.

## Core Features

### Key Management
- **PGP Key Generation and Storage**: Create and manage OpenPGP keys directly through the desktop client
- **Encrypted Key Backup**: Optional secure storage of encrypted master keys

### Disposable Email Addresses
- **On-Demand Email Creation**: Generate random addresses tied to your public key
- **Customizable Expiration**: Set time limits for temporary addresses
- **Automatic Forwarding**: Messages arrive securely at your main account

### Enhanced Privacy
- **Metadata Protection**: Minimize tracking through disposable addressing
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All internal communications fully encrypted

## Technical Implementation

Built using modern, auditable technologies:
- **Server**: Postfix mail server with custom PGP integration
- **Key Server**: Hagrid-based implementation (similar to keys.openpgp.org)
- **Frontend**: Minimal Next.js interface for account management
- **Security**: Open source codebase for transparency and community validation

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

KeyKeeper employs a true zero-knowledge architecture:

#### Server-Side (Everything Encrypted)
- All email content is stored fully encrypted on our servers
- Our systems only see encrypted data blobs, never plaintext content
- Your private key is never transmitted to or stored on our servers
- We only store your public key for verification and encryption
- Even email metadata is minimized and obscured where possible

#### Client-Side (Where Decryption Happens)
- Decryption occurs exclusively in your browser or desktop client
- Your private key remains on your device (or secured in your hardware key)
- Email content is decrypted only after secure transmission to your device
- Search functionality runs locally on decrypted content, not server-side
- Composition and replies are encrypted on your device before transmission

This architecture ensures that even if our servers were compromised, attackers would only access encrypted data they couldn't read. We simply cannot access your messages, even if compelled to do so.
