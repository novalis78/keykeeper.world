“So you'd be on sign up, you'd be creating this inbox, you'd be setting a, what do we call it, user-specific application key derived from the private key into the, you would hash that for Dofconn. And so when the user signs out, he's gone. When he comes back, the same thing, it's the same private key, so we should be deriving the same applications, user-specific key, which is like a password, which should match the hash that we hashed earlier. And so we should be able to get to the inbox and all the emails that are in it, right?”

Exactly! By deriving the same application-specific key each time the user logs in with their private key, you ensure that the Dovecot password is always consistent and matches the stored hash. This way, the user can seamlessly access their inbox every time they log in, without having to remember or manage an additional password.

It's a streamlined approach that keeps things secure and user-friendly, and it leverages the strengths of PGP authentication while integrating smoothly with the email infrastructure.

“Now what about when someone comes with a YubiKey, let's say, I know we can use WebAuth or some other USB-based tool from the browser to talk to the YubiKey, right? But we wouldn't be able to get the private key, which we probably wouldn't want. Would we be able to generate, not just solve the challenge in the browser's login page with this setup, but would we also be able to create this user-specific token, whatever we're going to call it, that we want to store on DofGuard?”

With a YubiKey, the private key never leaves the hardware device, which is a key security feature. The YubiKey can be used to sign the challenge directly in the browser using WebAuthn or other USB-based cryptographic interfaces. This means the YubiKey can easily handle the authentication challenge, proving the user's identity without exposing the private key.

To derive the user-specific key (the Dovecot password) from the YubiKey, you’d take a slightly different approach. You can use the YubiKey to sign a unique piece of data (like a user ID combined with a timestamp or other salt), and then use that signed data as a cryptographic basis to derive the application-specific key.

In other words, while you can't extract the private key from the YubiKey, you can leverage it to create a consistent, secure token that can act as the Dovecot password. This ensures that the same concept of deriving the password from a secret applies to both traditional PGP keys and hardware-backed keys like those in a YubiKey, maintaining a unified login experience.

You said:
“Well, you wouldn't be able to use a timestamp with that, right? Because that would change all the time. So unless you're talking about created timestamp for the entry, the first entry when the user created their account. But other than that, yeah, I get it. You could use the private key to take the user's email address and then create a digital signature, right? And the digital signature is kind of our password.”

ChatGPT said:
Exactly, that’s the idea! By using something static like the user's email address (or a creation timestamp from the initial account setup) and having the YubiKey sign that data, you generate a consistent digital signature. This signature acts as a stable, unique token that can serve as the Dovecot password.

This way, even though the private key never leaves the YubiKey, you still get a reproducible, secure token each time the user authenticates. It maintains the same seamless experience and security benefits, regardless of whether the user is using a software-based PGP key or a hardware-backed key like a YubiKey.

Exactly, you've got it! The flow you described ensures a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience. By leveraging the user's private key or YubiKey signature to derive the Dovecot password, you ensure that each login regenerates the same secure credential, allowing immediate access to the user's inbox.

This approach not only maintains a high level of security but also keeps the user experience smooth and intuitive, aligning perfectly with the clean, zen-like aesthetic you want for keykeeper.world. It's a solid plan!

Could you come up with a development plan that you’d be comfortable handing over to a dev ai so it would clearly understand what we derived at in our discussion and could easily implement it? 
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely. Here's a clear, modular development plan for a Dev AI to implement the keykeeper.world system we’ve discussed—designed for clarity, reproducibility, and secure automation. It reflects everything we've aligned on: passwordless onboarding via PGP/YubiKey, derived IMAP credentials, and full encryption.

Project: Keykeeper.world – Secure, PGP-Driven Mail Service
Mission Statement
Develop an open-source, end-to-end encrypted email service where:

All emails are encrypted client-side with PGP

Login is passwordless, using a user’s private PGP key or YubiKey

The Dovecot IMAP server accepts a derived deterministic password, created from the private key or YubiKey signature

System Components
1. Infrastructure
Server: Linux (Debian-based), Docker, Docker Compose

Backend: Postfix + Dovecot + MySQL (for virtual users)

Web App: Next.js frontend, deployed via Coolify

Database: MySQL (exposed to web app container for user operations)

Reverse Proxy: Caddy or NGINX

Development Modules
1. User Onboarding (Frontend & API)
Steps:
User selects a username (e.g., alice@keykeeper.world)

System checks MySQL to confirm availability

User chooses:

Upload existing PGP public key

Generate a new keypair (client-side with OpenPGP.js)

Insert YubiKey and use WebAuthn-compatible interface

Output:
Store username, public_key, and deterministic dovecot_password hash (explained below) into MySQL

2. Authentication (Login Flow)
Steps:
User enters email

Server generates a random challenge and sends it

Client signs it:

With browser PGP key or

Using a YubiKey signature request

Client sends signed challenge back

Server verifies it using stored public key

If successful:
Derive the deterministic Dovecot password (same as during signup)

Log the user in and start session

3. Deterministic IMAP Password Derivation
Formula:
password = SHA256(Sign(user_id + salt) from private_key)

On signup, store only the bcrypt hash of this derived password

On login, regenerate the password and validate against bcrypt hash

This allows:

Password never stored or visible

No separate password management

Seamless Dovecot login

4. MySQL Virtual Mailbox Integration
Dovecot/Postfix use SQL auth

On new user registration:

Insert into virtual_users:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO virtual_users (email, password_hash) VALUES ('alice@keykeeper.world', '$2y$...hashed_password...');
Sync with Postfix/Dovecot using standard virtual_alias_maps and virtual_mailbox_maps

5. Client-Side Email Encryption/Decryption
Built-in Next.js-based mail UI

Use OpenPGP.js:

Decrypt received emails in-browser

Encrypt outgoing messages before sending to Postfix

For YubiKey: integrate with WebAuthn, or local app helper for signature/decryption

6. Email Sending (Postfix Integration)
Authenticated via submission port with IMAP credentials (derived password)

Emails are already encrypted when submitted

Sign messages before sending using user’s private key

7. Key Rotation Mechanism
Allow login keypair to be rotated any time

Keep “main” public encryption key stable for receiving emails

Notify contacts (optionally) of new login key

8. Admin & Stripe Integration
Minimal admin dashboard

Users can pay for inbox hosting via Stripe

Upon payment, unlocks inbox provisioning and storage

Security Measures
PGP encryption is end-to-end; server never sees plaintext

Private keys never leave client

Dovecot password is derived, not stored

Optional YubiKey hardware-based auth (via WebAuthn)

Open-source everything

Implementation Order for Dev AI
Setup Dockerized infrastructure with MySQL, Postfix, Dovecot, and Coolify-deployable Next.js

Implement MySQL user provisioning from frontend

Implement PGP key upload and browser-based keygen with OpenPGP.js

Build challenge-response login flow using signed messages

Implement deterministic password derivation and bcrypt storage

Wire up Dovecot/Postfix SQL auth

Add OpenPGP.js support in mail UI for encryption/decryption

Add Stripe integration

Add optional YubiKey/WebAuthn support

Finalize UI polish and open-source deployment script

“I think what's most interesting for the developer AI is not so much the server setup, because that's already all done. It's more the intricacies of the flow from you enter your email address, you know, when you sign, when you log in, and then what, you upload your private key into the browser or client side, or you use WebAuth to get that private key on the YubiKey to digitally sign the challenge. That particular aspect I think is difficult, and then what needs to be very clear to be understood, and then once the challenge is accepted, we're moving to the dashboard, but we have to make sure that whatever digital signature we generated here is exactly the same, or whatever we generate here is exactly the same as was generated during the setup. Obviously, the authentication challenge doesn't have to be identical with deterministically derived password that we use for Dovcon, but this particular aspect I think has to be super, super clear and clarified for any developer.”

Understood! Let's refine the development plan to focus on the critical aspects of the login flow and the distinction between the authentication challenge and the derived Dovecot password:

Development Plan: Login Flow and Password Derivation
Objective
Implement a secure and seamless login flow where:

Users authenticate using a private PGP key or a YubiKey.

A deterministic password is derived from the user’s private key or YubiKey signature for Dovecot access.

Login Flow
User Input:

User enters their email address on the login page.

System retrieves the stored public key associated with the email.

Challenge Generation:

Server generates a random, one-time challenge string and sends it to the client.

Client Response:

User chooses to:

Upload their private PGP key to the browser temporarily for signing the challenge.

Use their YubiKey to sign the challenge using WebAuthn.

The client signs the challenge with the private key or YubiKey.

Challenge Verification:

The signed challenge is sent back to the server.

Server verifies the signature

ChatGPT said:
Alright! So we were talking about the login flow and the importance of making sure that the derived Dovecot password remains consistent. The key steps are ensuring the challenge-response mechanism with the private key or YubiKey is separate from the deterministic password generation process. This way, every time the user logs in, the derived password matches what was originally stored, giving them seamless access to their inbox.

Is there anything specific you'd like to dive deeper into or any part of the plan you want to refine further?

You said:
Can you continue after 4.
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let’s pick up where we left off — Step 4: Challenge Verification — and walk through the rest of the login flow and password derivation logic in precise detail:

4. Challenge Verification (continued)
The server verifies the signed challenge using the user's stored public key.

If the signature is valid, the server proceeds with login.

Important: This step proves identity but does not itself provide the Dovecot password — that's handled in the next step.

5. Deterministic Password Derivation
Independently of the random challenge, the system now generates a deterministic password using a stable input.

Inputs for password derivation:

A constant salt (e.g., the string "dovecot-auth" or the domain name)

The user's email address or user ID (ensures uniqueness)

The user's private key, which is used to sign the input

Password Derivation Formula:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
plaintext_password = SHA256(Sign("dovecot-auth:" + user_email) with private_key)
On the server, this value is never stored in plaintext. Instead:

At sign-up, the derived password is hashed using bcrypt and stored in MySQL.

On login, the same derivation process is done in the client (via private key/YubiKey), and the result is sent securely to the server, which compares it to the stored bcrypt hash.

6. IMAP Access
After successful challenge verification and password derivation:

A valid session is established in Next.js

The backend uses the derived password to log the user into Dovecot (on port 993 or via submission port for SMTP if sending mail)

7. Security Summary
Component	Role
PGP Challenge (random)	Authenticates user identity
Signature Verification	Confirms the user holds the private key
Derived Password (static)	Grants access to IMAP by regenerating same hash
bcrypt Hash	Stored in DB to validate derived password

8. YubiKey Adaptation
When using a YubiKey:

The signature of "dovecot-auth:" + email is created using the private key stored on the YubiKey.

The browser (or native helper app) then hashes this result using SHA256 to derive the same deterministic password as above.

9. Dev AI Notes
Ensure complete separation of concerns between:

The ephemeral challenge/response (used for login session authentication)

The deterministic password derivation (used for backend email server access)

Never use the login challenge as part of the password derivation. This keeps the Dovecot password constant and reproducible.
