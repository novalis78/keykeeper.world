After analyzing the code, here's the issue:

  1. Missing Step: The private key is available during login (in login/page.js) but it's not being stored OR used to derive the mail password before
  redirecting to the dashboard.
  2. Current Flow:
    - User enters email in step 1
    - Gets challenge in step 2
    - Uploads/pastes private key and signs challenge
    - Upon success, the login logic sets the auth token in localStorage
    - User is redirected to dashboard WITHOUT storing the derived password
  3. Dashboard Flow:
    - Dashboard loads and tries to fetch inbox
    - No mail credentials available
    - Dashboard shows credentials modal instead of automatically using derived password
  4. Key Missing Components:
    - No code that derives the mail password during login using the available private key
    - No code that stores this derived password in localStorage/sessionStorage
    - The login process has access to the private key but doesn't use it for the mail password
    - The dashboard tries to fetch existing mail credentials but can't find any
  5. Debug Points to Add:
    - In login/page.js: Log if private key is correctly loaded and when signature is created
    - In handleSignChallenge: Add code to derive mail password and store it
    - In dashboard's inbox fetching: Log if trying to use stored credentials and if found
    - In mailCredentialManager.js: Add debug statements showing what storage keys exist

  The fundamental issue is the auth flow and mail credentials flow are disconnected. We need to:

  1. After successful challenge verification in login, use the private key that's already in memory to derive the mail password
  2. Store this derived password in localStorage/sessionStorage with a stable key
  3. When dashboard loads, use this stored password instead of showing the credentials modal
